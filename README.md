Logic, Conditionals, and Loops are some of the most important concepts in all of Software Development. When we work with Loops, 
very often are also working with Arrays (or another Data Structure). One of the most common things to do with a loop is to access
every element of an Array to do something. Often we want to test a condition (a test) to see determine
what we will do next in our program.
